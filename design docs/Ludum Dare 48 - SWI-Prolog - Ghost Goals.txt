So ghost goals are win conditions. Something left unfulfilled in life the ghost needs to go deeper and deeper into dreams to solve. Could be a puzzle mechanically, but style-wise we're preferring psychological type goals.

============
GHOST GOALS (unfulfilled in life)
============
Find Your Lover!
Avoid the Monster (Your Ex-Lover)!
Punch Pat!
Apologize to Pat for Punching Them!
Eat a Great Sandwich!!!
Go Skydiving!

(consider 1- 2- or 3-player ghost goals as we may incorporate multiplayer (like your lover is a player wandering with their own goal but you need to find them to win, or if there are no players your lover is an AI in a specific/random? dream))
