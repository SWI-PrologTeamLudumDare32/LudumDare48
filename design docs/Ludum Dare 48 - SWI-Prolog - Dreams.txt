Each dream is a simple interactive narrative. Can contain art, music, audio, etc. It can have puzzle mechanics or even be a simple type of game e.g. a tiny platformer. Usually you get about 2 minutes per dream in real-time to make your way through, might just be one minute.

OVERWORLD INTRO

You wake up. You are dead. You float up out of your lifeless body and see someone sleeping on a bed nearby. Next to the bed is an end-table with an alarm clock. What do you do?

	[Freak Out]			OMG I'm dead I'm dead I'm dead!!!!
	[Loot your own Corpse]		You find a phone and some pocket lint, but you can't use them. Because you're dead.
	[Smash the Alarm Clock]		You try to smash the alarm clock, but you have no arms. And you're not corporeal. And being a freshly-minted ghost you simply don't have the telekinetic strength. Too bad...
	[Possess the dreamer]		As you float over to the bed, you notice an alarm clock set to ____ 2 minutes. Should the alarm clock go off before you heal your biggest regret or possess another dreamer, you will be lost in the Unconscious until your sleeper goes back to sleep. You're certain your lover is somewhere in the Collective Subconscious; after all, with only seven degrees of separation between any two people and knowing that the most random people can show up in others' dreams, they must be in there somewhere. You are now entering your ______ first-level dream; once you dive to a deeper dream level, the previous alarm clock will pause until you go back to that world. Don't be afraid to go deeper, and good luck! You possess the dreamer. {sound}
		so level 0 alarm clock pauses on level 2, etc.
Now to sleep, perchance to dream...



JUNGLE DREAM

You wake up. You're in a jungle. You hear a tiger roar. {sound} It sounds really close! What do you do?

	[Run!] 			You run from the tiger as fast as your hobbit legs can carry you. You hear rustling and growling {sound} as the tiger hears you and gives chase. You find a small yurt, just in the knick of time, run in, and slam the straw door, thinking "That probably won't hold..." What do you do?
		[Jump in the fireplace!]
			With a running start, you dive headfirst into the fireplace, {sound} {wilhelm scream?} where you are instantly killed. If you die in dreams, you die in real life. So you are now dead. But you are also a ghost in real life. So you were already dead. Realizing this, you float out of your lifeless body and are now a ghost in this dream. You wake up. You are dead. You float up out of your lifeless body and see the tiger burst into the door so hard it splats right into an iron headboard and onto the bed below, out cold. Time is ticking. What do you do?
				[Possess the tiger]
					You possess the sleeping tiger. You notice the alarm clock is set to 2 minutes
		
	[Give Up and Die!]	You give up, you shout out to the tiger, "Here kitty kitty, come eat me!" The tiger obliges. {sound} {death} You are dead. If you die in dreams, you die in real life. So you are now dead. But you are also a ghost in real life. So you were already dead. Realizing this, you float out of your lifeless body and are now a ghost in this dream. The clock is ticking... What do you want to do?
		[Fly!]		You fly high into the clouds and see the entire world is smoldering ashes and badlands except for that beautiful little jungle. You keep flying for a very long time. You begin to miss that precious little emerald miles below you. Suddenly you fly right through some kind of floating fortress. By the grimy walls, faint moans and clanging of metal, you are cleary in some kind of dungeon.
				[Go Left]	You go left. There is a massive door blocking your way. You use your ghostly powers of deduction to deduce - after failing to charge right through the door and succeeding in bumping your ghostly little noggin - that the door is in fact magical and requires a magical key to unlock. You're pretty sure you hear some snoring on the other side of this door. Time is ticking. What do you do?
					NEW QUEST: Find the Magical Key to unlock the Magical Bedroom Door in the Flying Fortress in the Jungle Dream.
						[Go Back the other way] You go back.
							[Go Left]
							[Go Right]
						[Wait for the love of your life to show up]
				[Go Right]	You go right. And you were right! Here's an old granny sleeping on a bed. At first you're not sure if she's alive, but sure enough you can hear the faintest snore as you get close. There is an alarm clock on the bed set for 8:00 AM; thanks to magical ghost powers you know it's about 7:58 AM right now. 
						[Possess the dreamer]
							[Yes] You dive into your next adventure, hoping the love of your life will be in this one.
							[No]  You wait. The clock is ticking. What do you do?
								[Go back] You go back.
									[Go Left]
									[Go Right]


SPACE DREAM

You wake up. You're a space man! No wait, you're in space, ma'am! Like floating out in space, watching the space station get smaller and smaller in front of you. What do you do?

	[Activate Propulsion Socks]
		You activate your propulsion socks. They don't work. With sheer willpower you launch yourself at the space station and eventually make it. Unfortunately, there is a robot inside who will not open the pod bay doors to let you in. After a candid radio chat, you determine all he wants from life is a red hat. 
			{You have the strangest feeling your long lost cousin is inside} 
			{ITEM NEEDED}{RED HAT}
	[Merge with the Omnipresent Void of the Infinite Cosmos]
		You merge with the Omnipresent Void of the Infinite Cosmos. You are one with OVIC. OVIC is one with you. Cheat codes enabled...
		You learn your lover is in _______ world, accessible through [[base this off of whatever quests they have unlocked]] a Magical Door, the key to which may be found in *sniff* oh oh God that's gross must be a sewer.
		Then with a great sneeze {sound} OVIC expels you, a little astronaut-shaped booger flying through space. You fly so fast that you open a wormhole and find yourself suddenly in a white room with a small white bed where a large white rat is sleeping.
		[Possess the Rat]
			Just before you possess the rat, you notice the alarm clock is set to 'blue'. Fragments from your recent bout of omnipotence indicate you've got [5 minutes]. You possess the rat. [[Sewer Dream]] 
		[Wait in the White Room for your lover]
	[Take off your Helmet and accept your fate]
		*Pchhhh  sssssss* The internal pressure releases as you take off your helmet. The total lack of external pressure results in the immediate and total explosion {sound} of your face. 
		You are dead. You float out of your lifeless body *cuh cuh gluh* You are a ghost. Ghosts cannot breathe in space. You suffocate.
		You are dead again. You are a ghost of your former ghostly self. Fortunately ghosts of ghosts can breathe in space. #DreamLogic Yep. What do you do?
			[Possess your ghost corpse]
				You possess your ghost corpse. What do you do?
					[Possess what's left of your original body]
						You possess your remains... Ewww... {sound} {squishy version of normal possession sound} They should call you Gross Ghost, because that's just ... ewww... What do you - you know what I can't even write this out it's so gross. I'm gonna go take a shower and wipe all this grossness off of me.
							[Take control of the narrative]
								I have taken control of the narrative. It's mine. All mine!!!! AH HAHAHAH AHHAHAHHAHHAHAHHAHHAHAHH AHAHHA AHHAHAHAHHAHHAHAHAHHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHHAHAHHA. Wow! A bed appears floating in space, and check that out: a wandering erg-lob is sleeping peacefully on the bed. I possess the erg-lob... 
	and lose control of the narrative - woooh that was close. Good thing I take really fast showers. So the alarm clock next to the erg-lob is set to @#&%*&HFDI!*U(#$):}{+-7, which means you should have approximately three minutes before She wakes up. Good luck, you fourth-wall-breaker you.

	[Float Slowly Towards that small moon]
		You float slowly...
			Oh so slowly...
				Ohhhhhhh.
					sooo.........
						slow.......................................
								l
								 y
		towards the small moon. And suddenly, you realize: that's no moon! It's a GIANT BED! With a GIANT!!!! SLEEPING ON IT!!!
		[Possess the sleeping giant]
		[You really want to do something else? Just possess the giant]
		[Okay fine, sit around and wait for your life's goal to achieve itself. You'll only run out the clock.]
			Tick... Tick... Tick... {sound}

@Aquasheep - GARDEN GNOME DREAM [[From Giant]] <------------------------------------------------------------- HUB WORLD


		You wake up. As far as your eyes can see there is grass. It's a sunny day, but massive shadows drape across the grass. You look up a bit to see castle-wall-sized hedges all around you. "This is amaze-ing," you exclaim in a shrill voice. You start hopping around with glee, but it's quite difficult to move as the blades of grass are huge and your legs appear to be stuck together. Suddenly, you hear an engine roar to life followed by the unmistakable sound of a lawnmower {sound}. The sound is getting closer. Time is ticking. What do you do?
			[Roll over and brace for impact]
				Good choice! You roll over, the lawnmower gets closer. Oh goodness it must be right behind you and -- a sound as if someone just put a helicopter through a cheese grater {sound} is gracefully cut short by a deafening explosion {sound}. The last thing you see is bits of porcelain flying away from you. Then everything goes black. 
				You are dead. You float up out of your lifeless body - or what's left of it. Time is ticking. What do you do?
					[Hold a funeral for yourself]
						With great effort, you telekinetically scoot a few pieces of your once-proud porcelain pape in a small pile on the grass. You say a quick prayer, something to the effect of "Rest in Pieces, mi amigo. You were a fragile, yet sturdy little body and will be missed." A single ectoplasmic tear falls down your ghostly visage and onto the lawn. Without any warning at all, a pool of purple Fate-o-rade opens beneath you. {sound} {like bubbling liquid maybe?} Entranced by the infinity of small distant shapes dancing in the depths of that pool, you enter.
						{Music} {Sound} {Art}
						You are now surrounded by liquid chaos: all possibilities morphing in and out of existence at once. The weight of this dimension drags you down making it difficult to float. Time is ticking. What do you do?
							[Cry]
								You cry for a bit. It feels good. The ectoplasm floats around in globules in the air. It's pretty gross. Time is ticking. What do you do? {{Code: Minimap feature?}}
								[Platform up the globules and get out of here]
									With great effort you leap from globule to globule of your globby gooey ghostly tears. Along the way, you find a silver cup and scoop up some of the liquid chaos {sound}  before leaping out of the portal back into the Hedgemaze. Epic! {Item} {Liquid Chaos} Time is ticking. What do you do?
								[Find a possibility with a bed in it]
									[Explore the Maze]
									[Drink the goo] {Code} {can this be anoption any time you have a certain item, to use it?}
							[Find a possibility with a bed in it]
								You leap into one of the infinite possibilities twirling around you. After a blinding flash of light you wander around until you sense a bed nearby. Without thinking, you possess a sleeper! Who knows where you might end up... Just as you dive in, you catch a faint glimpse of their alarm clock, which is set to go off ten minutes from now.
					[Explore the Maze]
					[Loot your corpse]
						With great effort, you telekinetically turn over the various bits and pieces of your shattered body until you find a pointy red porcelain hat {Item}. You use all the rest of your ghostly powers to float the hat atop your head. Style! Time is ticking. What do you do?
							[Explore the Maze]
							[Activate Hat] {Code} {Hat icon like compass}
								You activate your hat with your mind. It spins around wildly on your ghostly head before stopping in the direction of the maze. You decide to explore the maze.
								
			[Hop away as fast as your tiny legs can take you]
				You hop and hop and hop. The lawnmower is getting closer. {sound} {background} It must be right behind you now. At the last minute you hop out of the way as it goes careening right through the hedges, creating a very convenient shortcut. A rather 2-Dimensional Pink Flamingo with thin metal legs takes off into the sky. {sound} Time is ticking. What do you do?
					[Take Shortcut]
						You take the shortcut right to the center of the maze. A large wrought-iron gazeebo rests there along with a pigeon in a tiny little bed inside a nest.
							[Possess the pigeon]
								You possess the pigeon, noting its egg-timer alarm clock is set to two minute from now.
					[Explore Maze]
						You hop {Code: if ghost, change to float} around the maze for hours, maybe even days. You hop left. You hop right. But most importantly, you keep on hopping until you find three little houses scattered about. One is made of straw, one of wood, and one of brick. Time is ticking. What do you do?
						[Take Shortcut to Center of Maze]
						[This choice is way too easy, some might even call it a STRAW man.]
							The moment you walk in the house, a sentry turret guns you down. {sound} {Good thing you are already a ghost!} {code} Pieces of porcelain fly everywhere before everything goes black. You are dead. You float up out of your lifeless body and {code start here if already ghost} see a medium-sized straw pig on a medium-sized straw bed with a medium-sized alarm-clock nearby. You also see some porridge nearby. Thinking "This is just right." You try to eat the porridge. Unfortunately, you are a ghost, so it just spills on the floor. Time is ticking. What do you do?	
								[Possess the Straw Pig]
									You possess the straw pig, taking note the alarm-clock is set for 2 minutes from now. 
								[Leave] {Code back to maze - float around the maze}
	
						[You WOOD pick this house.]
							The moment you walk in a hatchet falls from the roof {sound} and kills you. {sound} {code} {good thing you were already a ghost!} {if you were already a ghost?} You are dead. You float up out of your lifeless body and see a large wooden pig sleeping on a large wooden bed shaped like an alarm clock.
								[Possess the Wood Pig]
									You possess the sleeping pig, taking note the bed-clock is set for ____ four minutes from now.
						[She's a BRICK... house!]

								[Possess the Brick Pig]
									You possess the sleeping pig, taking note the alarm clock is set for ____ three minutes from now.
					
					
			[Fart]
				You clench your fists - and your buns - and let out a solid fart. {sound} Not a 10 by any stretch, but probably a 6. Solid. Unintimidated, the lawnmower is getting closer {sound} {background}. Now that you're more relaxed, you hear a faint beeping {sound} in the nearby bushes. Time is ticking. What do you do?

				[Search the bushes]
					You search the bushes and find a metal detector! Wicked!!! {Item} The lawnmower is very close now but it zooms past you following along the hedge maze with frightening speed and precision. {sound} {background} As the lawmower zooms past, a rather 2-Dimensional Pink Flamingo with thin metal legs takes off into the sky. {sound} Time is ticking. What do you do?
				[Explore the Maze]
					The lawnmower is very close. You wait a moment as it hurtles down the hedge maze path with frightening speed and precision {sound}. As the lawnmower zooms past, a rather 2-Dimensional Pink Flamingo with thin metal legs takes off into the sky. {sound}
		
					You hop {Code: if ghost, change to float} around the maze for hours, maybe even days. You hop left. You hop right. But most importantly, you keep on hopping until you find three little houses scattered about. One is made of straw, one of wood, and one of brick. Time is ticking. What do you do?

						[Use metal detector]
							You hop some more, possibly for weeks. Good thing dream time works differently or that alarm clock would have gone off by now. Trusty metal detector at hand, you beep your way to the very center of the maze. A large wrought-iron gazeebo rests there and-- As you approach the gazeebo, the metal detector starts beeping wildly. {sound} Suddenly a land mine goes off. {sound} Porcelain pieces fly everywhere, {sound} {smashing plate?} and everything goes black. You are dead. You float up out of your lifeless body and see a pigeon in a tiny little bed inside a nest. Time is ticking. What do you do?
							[Possess the pigeon]
								You possess the pigeon, noting its egg-shaped alarm clock is set to two minutes from now. {{Heavy Metal}}
							[Go to Straw House] {ghost}
							[Go to Wood House]
							[Go to Brick House]							
							
						
					
			[Search for something useful]
				You root around a little in the tall grass. The lawnmower is getting closer. {sound} {background} You hear some rustling, investigate, and are pleased to find a rather 2-Dimensional Pink Flamingo with thin metal legs. Time is ticking. The lawnmower is approaching. What do you do?
					[Mount Up]
						With the grace of an ace pilot, you leap onto your steed. Startled it takes off into the sky, {sound} leaving lawnmower, hedgemaze, and frustratingly tall grass behind. From up here you see it all, a medium-sized straw house, a large wood house, and a little brick house. There also appears to be a wrought-iron gazeebo in the center of the maze. Too scared to let go, you let the pink flamingo take you higher and higher so high that you can't breathe anymore. 
						Slapping the flamingo wildly, {sound} you try to get it to descend, but to no avail. The flamingo goes up and rests on a pillow-shaped cloud with a cloud-shaped pillow on top and a completely normal hover-clock floating nearby. Unfortunately it is at this moment your lungs cannot bear it anymore. Everything goes black. {sound} {Death} You are dead. You float up out of your lifeless body and see the flamingo sleeping on the bed. Time is ticking. What do you do?
						[Possess the Flamingo]
							You possess the flamingo, noting the hover-clock is set to three minutes from now.
 
					[Explore the Maze]
						The lawnmower is very close. {sound} {background} You wait a moment as it hurtles down the hedge maze path with frightening speed and precision. As the lawnmower zooms past, the rather 2-Dimensional Pink Flamingo with thin metal legs takes off into the sky. {sound}
		
						You hop around the maze for hours, maybe even days. You hop left. You hop right. But most importantly, you keep on hopping until you find three little houses scattered about. One is made of straw, one of wood, and one of brick. Time is ticking. What do you do?

@hank FIRST KISS IN POURING RAIN DREAM [[From ]]
	- but they're both actual walruses
	
	
- You wake up. Your partner's dark eyes look back into yours, seeing your soul. In them, you can see the sun, a light. The air was the perfect temperature. You could taste the sea in the air but it wasn't overbearing. A crisp, refreshing taste that revitalized your youth and your passion for one another. You never had a moment together so serene as this one. You remember this... your first kiss.
[You keep staring longingly into your partner's deep, dark eyes.]
- You keep staring longingly into your partner's deep, dark eyes. Your family disagreed when they first learned of the romance. It wasn't deemed appropriate. Your father called their family "giant terrible monsters." He claimed that you were never to associate with them, that it would soil your family's good name. You didn't care. 
- A nudge. A brief nuzzle under your snout to bring you back to the present moment. Your partner reminding you where you belong, in the here and now, together. It started to rain, ever so gently.
[This is meant to be.]
- This is meant to be. Why can father not see how things truly are? That these outdated principles only serve to further divide our people? That if we were able to mix our families, our bloodlines only grow stronger. If we combine and share our resources, we will all inherently be provided with substantial wealth?
- A second nudge. Your partner knows how your mind wanders. Knows you so well. The rain slightly intensified, in size and in speed.
[Nudge back]
- You nudge back at the nape of your partner's neck and share an intimate moment. Their hot breath seeps into your eyes and up your nostrils, but you don't mind. The rain immediately cools down your body. The combination of the ice beneath your body and the heat above your bald head only serve to further your heightened emotional response. 
[Oh it's on now]
- Oh, it's on now! You puff the sack of skin under your neck to display your arousal. It's been so long, you never thought you'd do that again. Your partner responds by puffing their sack to you, a sign of unwavering intimacy. You slap your partner's face gently, yet firmly at the same time. Your tusks rub against one another. Your partner slaps you twice on each side of your bulbous head. Your whiskers vibrate as the sack of skin beneath your neck bulges with compassion, even without you allowing it.
- Two more slaps to the side of your head. Slap! Slap! Oh, how you've never felt like this before. One more slap, hard slap, at the edge of your snout. SLAP! You can hardly hold yourself together anymore. Your air sack, bulging with anticipation. Both of your tusks rotate back as your mouths come closer together...
[Kiss the other walrus]

@blueloveTH - EPIC BATTLE DREAM [[From ]]

You wake up. You're in a castle. In front of you is a staff and a sword. What do you do?

	[Pick the stuff]
		You picks the stuff. A group of Goblins appears. They are rushing towards you with daggers!

		[Stuff Attack!]
			You raise your staff and wave it towards an enemy.
			With a crisp sound, your staff breaks into two parts under the enemy's parry.
			At the next second, the Goblins easily captured you.
		[Retreat]
			You calmly analyze the situation and decide to go back some distance.
			At this time, you find that the Goblins are very close to each other, and your spells are ready.
			What do you do?
			[Fireball!]
				You chant the spell, summon a huge fireball.
				The fireball landed among the enemies, turning all of them into ashes.
			[Frost Ward!]
				You chant the spell, an ice barrier appears around your body.
				Goblins start using their daggers to attack you. But no effects.
				However, you are surrounded. What do you do?
				[Stuff Attack!]
					You raise your staff and wave it towards an enemy.
					The attack missed, but it makes your energe unstable.
					The ice barrier explodes and then repels the Goblins.
					You've also taken a lot of damage.
				[Wait for the Next Spell]
					You try to maintain the barrier, but quickly become exhausted.
					After that, the ice barrier collapses and you fall down.

	[Take the sword]
		You takes the sword. A Giant appears, with a huge rock in hand aiming at you!
		What do you do?

		[Defend!]
			You raise your sword and adopt a defensive posture.
			The rock hits you accurately and ruins this trivial defense
			...along with your body.
		[Dodge!]
			You move quickly. The rock landed in your left. BOOM!!
			With flying sand and dust, it is not able to see the situation over there.
			What do you do next?
			[Charge!]
				"The best defense is to attack."
				You rush towards the Giant, and use the sword to launch a continuous attack on it.
				However, it dealt trivial damage.
				On the next second, the Giant punches you, and then you fly tens of meters away...
			[Move Left]
				You move left towards the position where the previous rock landed.
				You found a pit!
					[Jump into it!]
						You jump into the pit without hesitation!
						... ...
						It takes a few seconds to hit the bottom.
						Though taking a great deal of damage, you left the battle alive.
					[Get closer to investigate]
						You try to get closer to the pit, want to see the details.
						At the same time, the Giant's second rock flies to you.
						While you have no time to react.
						BOOM!!
			[Move Right]
				You move right, trying to find a good position.
				At this time, the Giant lifts another rock, aiming at you!
				[Charge!]
					"The best defense is to attack."
					You rush towards the Giant, and use the sword to launch a continuous attack on it.
					However, it dealt trivial damage.
					On the next second, the Giant punches you, and then you fly tens of meters away...
				[Defend!]
					You raise your sword and adopt a defensive posture.
					The rock hits you accurately and ruins this trivial defense
					...along with your body.
				[Dodge!]
					You are in a good position, so you escaped from that attack again.
					... ...
					After several rounds, the Giant exhausted.
					
					[Charge!]
						You rush towards the Giant, and use the sword to terminate it.

>>> == Exit Dream


-----------------------------

@hank Forgot Pants at School Dream

- (In a classroom. Chalkboard, desks, and an analog clock are viewable.)
- (It sounds like a groovy educational yet improvisational jazz jam. Maybe a ticking clock.)

- You wake up. You are in a classroom. You are a young, impressionable student. You forgot your pants. Your peers snicker, most likely at your lack of pants. Oh no! Not again. What is the answer to question number eight?

	[Apologize and promise to remember pants next time]
		- You apologize and promise to remember pants next time. You assure everyone this the last time you make the same speech about remembering your pants next time. How this keeps happening is beyond your understanding but your desire for change will surely bring it forth.
		- Everyone completely understands. Your classmates salute you with various fingers. Your teacher arises from behind her desk to reveal that she too forgot her pants. Actually, no one had pants on this whole time. What's the BFD?
		[Claim your independence as your own country]
			- You claim your independence as your own country. It's long overdue. Taxes are ridiculous.
			- Soon, your classmates begin shunning you for illegally being in their country.
			- And you actually end up having to pay more taxes somehow.
			- Taxes are ridiculous. 
>>>
		[Bestow five Bravery points to everyone without pants]
			- You bestow five Bravery points to everyone without pants. This may have been a mistake. These Bravery points have to come from somewhere. And... they come from you.
			- 25 people at 5 points a pop, and you only have 4 Bravery points to begin with.
			- You currently have -121 Bravery. This is unacceptable. You're dead now.
			- But actually through a fluke you've given yourself five points of bravery as well (by not wearing pants). And negative values aren't conditionally attributed to existing values, it reverts to 0.
			- You've recieved +5 points of Bravery. You have 5 Bravery points. You're alive! With pants this time too! 
>>>
		[Sing Eddie Money]
			- You sing Eddie Money. You try anyway. You can't remember any lyrics. There was that one about 'shaking' or something. And didn't he do that one TV show song? You can't remember the words from that one either, or the show.
			- Oh well, everyone is totally impressed by your performance anyway.
			- Next time you'll have to do you a real song, you think to yourself. 
>>>
	[Blame local energy companies]
		- You blame the local energy companies. Their price gouging has impacted the local economy for long enough. The system was designed with specific checks and balances, yet this racketeering continues unimpeded. That's why you're not wearing pants.
		- The lights turn off. The air conditioning ceases. It's almost as if time has ceased to continue. You can't help but feel that they are listening, and that you are responsible.
		- Suddenly, there is no hope. Your feet are cold but your skin is on fire. A rumbling vibrates through the school's walls and somehow you feel it exists only to beckon you to follow it.
		[Break the window and jump out]
			- You break the window and jump out. The fear takes over. That rumbling is too scary. Fight or flight kicks in and you are flighting.
			- It reminds you of that time with the thing that you ran from. Hohoho that was scary, remember?
			- Let's hope you don't dream about that anymore ever again.
			- As you defenestrate yourself from an incredibly high story in the schoolhouse, you wonder about the other possiblities. 
>>>
		[Follow it]
			- You follow it. The rumbling leads you out of the classroom through the halls. The sound eminates from every direction. No matter which way you go, you are certain it is the right way.
			- Louder and louder, it calls to you. You've read some stories like this before. About guys going following disturbing forces that beckon them into the inexplicable darkness.
			- Where the search for knowledge and understanding only yields more questions, darkness, and insanity.
			- Caddyshack, that was the movie. 
>>>
		[Just ignore it]
			- Big whoop, an impending, ominous rumbling requests your presence? So what! You scoff at the power outage and dimensions you don't understand and go back to blaming the energy companies.
			- It's dark in here.
			- You think about other impending, ominous rumblings that have requested your presence. Nothing bad ever happened with them before. And nothing bad is going to happen now. 
>>>
		

	[Connect with your classmates on a level you thought impossible]
		- You connect with your classmates on a level you thought impossible. You thought it was impossible before, yet it was easily doable. Human connection. Person to person.
		- It turns out sometimes you just need to ask someone a question about themselves.
		- You're left in awe at your misunderstanding of possibilities. You thought yourself to be reasonable and focused. Logical. Always able to give a good estimation. You should have worn pants, though. Really should have.
		- You're close enough with everyone now though. You all know each other well and feel comfortable not wearing pants around each other. It's probably fine from now on either way.
		[Pants are just a form a population control anyway]
		- Pants are just a form of population control anyway. They keep us down. We have to wear them because society says we do. And the fat cat pants guys are sitting on mountains of cash.
		- This sparks another dialog with your classmates, that engages you intimately on a level you thought impossible.
>>>

	[D. All of the Above]
		- You apologize and promise to remember pants next time, while blaming the local energy companies and connecting with your classmates on a level you thought impossible. Did that work? One of them has to be right.
		- There is no effect. Usually this answer always works out. Statiscally over 33 percent of that particular multiple choice answer has to be correct assuming the teacher has a soul and the correct answer is even present.
		- Maybe you overwhelmed the system, or it's a bug.
		- Maybe the teacher didn't put the answer on here.
		- Maybe Game of Thrones was kind of lame. You can't let anyone know you think that though. That's worse than the pants thing.

@hank Teeth on a Date dream


- (Restauraunt setting. Your shadowy-silhoutted date sits across from you)
- (Mumbling of others talking and light diner-esque music grooves from a crappy speaker)

- You wake up. You are on a date at a restaurant with an unfamiliar romantic partner. All of your teeth fall out of your mouth into your cupped hands. The taste reminds you of pennies.

	[Present the pile of teeth as a gift to your unfamiliar romantic partner]
		- You present the pile of teeth as a gift to your unfamiliar romantic partner. They are thrilled. It was very thoughtful of you. A selfless action. You are a good person. 
		- If only the world had more philanthropic and compassionate people like yourself. Other couples look on in jealousy at the spark between the two of you. 
		[You congratulate yourself on being such a great gift giver]
		- You congratulate yourself on being such a great gift giver. That one artist guy gave someone his ear. He kept all his teeth. Selfish. Or was he a writer?
		- Given that correllation, you should be pretty great at art now too. Or writing. One of the two. Maybe both. A bunch of teeth is more than one ear.
		- You make a mental note to produce art of some type later.
		- All that inspiration has made you thirsty, but you find drinking exceptionally challenging after being so used to your teeth's presence in your mouth.
		- You ask the waiter for a straw. It's not any easier. The water pours from your mouth due to your inability to purse your lips. 
>>>

	[Put the pile of teeth in your soup]
		- You put the pile of teeth in your soup. Some sink faster than others. This place never sends crackers out with the soup. You wonder why that is. You'll have to remember that when you leave the tip.
		- Maybe you have to ask for crackers. Maybe they don't send them out automatically because then each individual bowl of soup costs more for them to distribute.
		- It's embarassing to have to ask about crackers. They should just send them out. If it's too expensive, then why don't they just raise the price of the soup by the cost of the crackers?
		- The waiter is walking by right now...
		[Ask about crackers]
			- You ask about crackers. It's embarassing. Everyone takes notice. The waiter looks at your bowl of soup with a sneer, then asks if you'd like a pack, perhaps to take home.
			[Accept]
				- You accept. You reflect silently to yourself about how they should have sent crackers in the first place.
				- Once the waiter is gone, your unfamiliar romantic partner voices an opinion similar to the one you just had.
				- You agree. Yes, they should have sent crackers in the first place. 
>>>
			[Decline]
				- You decline. You already put your teeth in the soup and you remember that you have crackers at home. You always have crackers at home.
				- Once the waiter is gone, your unfamiliar romantic partner reminds you that you have crackers at home.
				- You remember again that you have crackers at home. 
>>>
			[Ask for two packs]
				- You ask for two packs. The waiter takes another look at your bowl and blinks slowly before walking away.
				- You'll have to remember that when you leave the tip.
				- It's hard for you to imagine he makes a decent living off of tips, given the way he treats the customers.
				- You hope he brings the crackers soon, though. The soup is starting to get cold and your teeth will be soggy soon. 
>>>
		[Don't ask about crackers]
			- You don't ask about crackers. It would be embarassing. I mean, it's fine. You already put your teeth in the soup.
			- You look around to see if anyone else has crackers. You don't even see another bowl of soup at any tables.
			- You stir your spoon through the soup, clinking your teeth at the bottom. They will get soggy soon, you think to yourself.
			- Your unfamiliar romantic partner warns you that you should eat your soup soon, before your teeth get soggy.
			- That's a reasonable suggestion, you think to yourself. What a wise and decisive unfamiliar romantic partner you've chosen. 
>>>

	[Ask to trade for your unfamiliar romantic partner's teeth, it's only fair]
		- You ask to trade for your unfamiliar romantic partner's teeth, it's only fair. This is commitment we're talking about. There's a big difference between living together and exchanging each others' teeth.
		- We have to be ready to lay it all on the line. To fully embrace each other. To look into each others' toothless mouths and fully accept ourselves, even if it's really really hard to eat stuff and drink stuff.
		- Ready to take the next step, your unfamiliar romantic partner accepts your offer. Soon both of you have cupped hands full of your own teeth.
		- You're both a little confused how the exchange is supposed to work out logistically. 
		- Measuring the available options you...
		[Pile your teeth in the center of the table]
			- You pile your teeth in the center of the table. It seemed like the right thing to do. It was the first possiblity that crept into your mind. And now they're there, in the center of the table where you put them.
			- Good job.
			- It's a good thing this place doesn't have centerpieces, you think to yourself. 
			- Your unfamiliar romantic partner looks at a with distaste. You probably inconvenienced them by placing your teeth in the center of the table.
			- You worry your unfamiliar romantic partner might regret the trade. You didn't mean to rush things.
			- Even if you didn't mean to rush things, you hurriedly extend your hands to alleviate your unfamiliar romantic partner of their teeth.
			- Placing them in your pocket, you're both left to look at each other over a pile of your own teeth. You can't help but feel like your teeth are worth more than those you just recieved, but oh well. 
>>>
		[Shove your silverware aside with the bottom of your cupped hands and pile your teeth on the napkin]
			- You shove your silverware aside with the bottom of your cupped hands and pile your teeth on the napkin. That worked out well. Nice. That's a good looking pile, you think to yourself.
			- Any unfamiliar romantic partner should be happy to recieve that in a fair and agreed upon exchange.
			- Your unfamiliar romantic partner performs similar actions to your own. Now there are two piles of teeth on their own respective napkins.
			- You might need another set of silverware though, these tables are filthy.
			- Your unfamiliar romantic partner furls your former napkin into a bag like shape and proceeds to place it somewhere upon its person, most likely a pocket.
			- You perform a similar action, it's a little harder than it looked. You drop a couple of your unfamiliar romantic partner's teeth on the floor during transport. 
>>>
		[Ask a third party to assist with the exchange]
			- You ask a third party to assist with the exchange. This is just too much to handle on your own. Somebody needs to be thinking about this from an outside perspective.
			- The waiter sulks towards the table in response to your pleading gaze and helpless befuddlement. He asks what he can do for you. You put your teeth in his hands.
			- Now your hands can recieve your unfamiliar romantic partner's teeth. Perfect. Good plan, you think to yourself.
			- And now your unfamiliar romantic partner's hands are free to recieve your teeth from the waiter.
			- The waiter unfurls your teeth into your unfamiliar romantic partner's lap, as if he wanted to be rid of them.
			- You'll have to remember that when you leave the tip. 
>>>

	[Plant the pile of teeth in the ground later when you get home, together]
		- You plant the pile of teeth in the ground later when you get home, together. 
		- You loosely pad the dirt on top of the teeth with your bare hands while your unfamiliar romantic partner returns with a full watering can.
		- This is the American Dream, you think to yourself.
		- Why, the world could end right now, and you'd still have a job tomorrow.
		- And in four to six weeks, these teeth are going to grow into something else. That's what life is.
		- You have a dreamy glob of an unfamiliar romantic partner and you planted teeth together at your home.
		- To some, that's a life well lived, and you're not even halfway there yet, you think to yourself. 
>>>
		
	[Plant the pile of teeth in the ground later when you get home, alone]
		- You plant the pile of teeth in the ground later when you get home, alone.
		- It's kinda sad doing this all by yourself, you think as you pad the dirt with your hands. You have to get up to get the watering can and end up tracking dirt all over the house. Dang it.
		- What's the point of planting teeth by yourself, you wonder.
		- Now the house is dirty and you've got responsibility, and nobody to pawn it off on.
		- And in four to six weeks, you'll probably still be alone and will have probably neglected these teeth you planted.
		- You go to bed and never wake up again.
