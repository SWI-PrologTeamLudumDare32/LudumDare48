Howdy -
Finally getting organized for Ludum Dare.

We're a team, so we're entering the 'Jam'.
Rules:
We can start with any base code.
If we use 3rd party assets we have to opt out of the relevant categoryy. We do have
an artist and musician, so no point in opting out.
The theme will be announced 6pm friday. 

How we'll work together:
CHANGE - we're going to use the Socializing over prolog and rpgs discord server, ludum-dare-48 as our primary channel rather than IRC. If you need an invite ping me over whatever medium we
first talked.
