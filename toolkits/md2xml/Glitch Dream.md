	Invalid input. Virus detected. Anti-virus protocol engaged. Threat neutralized. Ghost detected. Emergency shutdown engaged. System clock disabled {disable all alarm-clocks} {{go to unconscious}} //Originally the alarm-clocks were planned to count down in real time and would pop you out of the current dream; this dream would stop that. Fortunately, we realized that was lame, so we didn't do it.
