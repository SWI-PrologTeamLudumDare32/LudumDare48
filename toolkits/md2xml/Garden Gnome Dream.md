GARDENGNOMEDREAM

You wake up. As far as your eyes can see there is grass. It's a sunny day, but massive shadows drape across the grass. You look up a bit to see castle-wall-sized hedges all around you. "This is amaze-ing," you exclaim in a shrill voice. You start hopping around with glee, but it's quite difficult to move as the blades of grass are huge and your legs appear to be stuck together. Suddenly, you hear an engine roar to life followed by the unmistakable sound of a lawnmower. The sound is getting closer. What do you /do?

+ [Roll over and brace for impact]
	Good choice! You roll over, the lawnmower gets closer. Oh goodness it must be right behind you and -- a sound as if someone just put a helicopter through a cheese grater  is gracefully cut short by a deafening explosion. The last thing you see is bits of porcelain flying away from you. Then everything goes black. You wake up. You are dead. You float up out of your lifeless body - or what's left of it. What do you do?
	+ [Hold a funeral for yourself]
		With great effort, you telekinetically scoot a few pieces of your once-proud porcelain pape in a small pile on the grass. You say a quick prayer, something to the effect of "Rest in Pieces, mi amigo. You were a fragile, yet sturdy little body and will be missed." A single ectoplasmic tear falls down your ghostly visage and onto the lawn. Without any warning at all, a pool of purple Fate-o-rade opens beneath you. Entranced by the infinity of small distant shapes dancing in the depths of that pool, you enter. You are now surrounded by liquid chaos: all possibilities morphing in and out of existence at once. The weight of this dimension drags you down making it difficult to float. What do you do?
		+ [Cry]
			You cry for a bit. It feels good. The ectoplasm floats around in globules in the air. It's pretty and gross. What do you do?
			+ [Platform up the globules and get out of here]
				With great effort you leap from globule to globule of your globby gooey ghostly tears. Along the way, you find a silver cup and scoop up some of the liquid chaos before leaping out of the portal back into the Hedgemaze. Epic! What do you do?
				+ [Explore the Maze]
					You float around the maze for hours, maybe even days. You float left. You float right. But most importantly, you keep on floating until you find three little houses scattered about. One is made of straw, one of wood, and one of brick. What do you do?
					+ [This choice is way too easy, some might even call it a STRAW man.]
						The moment you walk in the house, a sentry turret guns you down. Good thing you're a ghost! You see a medium-sized straw pig on a medium-sized straw bed with a medium-sized alarm-clock nearby. You also see some porridge nearby. Thinking "This is just right." You try to eat the porridge. Unfortunately, you are a ghost, so it just spills on the floor. What do you do?	
						+ [Haunt Their Dreams!]
							You possess the straw pig, grabbing the alarm clock as you dive in.
<exit dream="nopantsatschooldream" />
					+ [You WOOD pick this house.]
						The moment you walk in a hatchet falls from the roof right on top of you. Good thing you're a ghost! You see a large wooden pig sleeping on a large wooden bed shaped like an alarm clock.
						+ [Haunt Their Dreams!]
							You possess the wood pig, deftly dismantling the alarm-part of the bed-clock and shoving it in your ghostly body.
<exit dream="firstkissdream" />
					+ [She's a BRICK... house!]
						The moment you walk in a proximity mine  Good thing you're a ghost! You see a little brick pig sleeping on a little brick bed with a little brick alarm clock next to her.
						+ [Haunt Their Dreams!]
							You possess the brick pig, you try to grab the alarm-clock to take with you but - it's bricked! Panicked, you throw it against the wall and suddenly it's working again. You shove it in your ghostly body and dive in.
<exit dream="teethonadate" />
				+ [Drink the goo]
			  		You drink the goo. It's delicious! 
			+ [Find one of the inifinite possibilities with a bed in it]
				You leap into one of the infinite possibilities twirling around you. After a blinding flash of light you wander around until you sense a bed nearby. Without thinking, you possess a sleeper! Who knows where you might end up... Oops! You almost forgot; you reach out, take the alarm clock, and shove it in your ghostly body.

	+ [Loot your corpse]
		With great effort, you telekinetically turn over the various bits and pieces of your shattered body until you find a pointy red porcelain hat {Item}. You use all the rest of your ghostly powers to float the hat atop your head. Style! What do you do?

		+ [Activate Hat]
			You activate your hat with your mind. It spins around wildly on your ghostly head before stopping in the direction of the maze. You decide to explore the maze.

+ [Hop away as fast as your tiny legs can take you]
	You hop and hop and hop. The lawnmower is getting closer. It must be right behind you now. At the last minute you hop out of the way as it goes careening right through the hedges, creating a very convenient shortcut. A rather 2-Dimensional Pink Flamingo with thin metal legs takes off into the sky.  What do you do?
	+ [Take Shortcut]
		You take the shortcut right to the center of the maze. A large wrought-iron gazeebo rests there along with a pigeon in a tiny little bed inside a nest.
		+ [Haunt their dreams!]
			You hop up to the pigeon cautiously so as not to wake it. A convenient landmine explodes. Everything goes black. You wake up. You are dead. You lift up out of your lifeless body and possess the still-sleeping pigeon, noting its egg-timer alarm clock and snatching it onto your ghostly person.

+ [Fart]
	You clench your fists - and your buns - and let out a solid fart.  Not a 10 by any stretch, but probably a 6. Solid. Unintimidated, the lawnmower is getting closer. Now that you're more relaxed, you hear a faint beeping in the nearby bushes. What do you do?
	+ [Search the bushes]
		You search the bushes and find a metal detector! Wicked!!! {Item} The lawnmower is very close now but it zooms past you following along the hedge maze with frightening speed and precision.  {background} As the lawmower zooms past, a rather 2-Dimensional Pink Flamingo with thin metal legs takes off into the sky.  What do you do?
		+ [Explore the Maze]

		+ [Use metal detector]
			You hop and hop, possibly for weeks. Good thing dream time works differently or that alarm clock would have gone off by now. Trusty metal detector at hand, you beep your way to the very center of the maze. A large wrought-iron gazeebo rests there and-- As you approach the gazeebo, the metal detector starts beeping wildly.  Suddenly a land mine goes off.  Porcelain pieces fly everywhere, and everything goes black. You wake up. You are dead.

+ [Search for something useful]
	You root around a little in the tall grass. The lawnmower is getting closer.  You hear some rustling, investigate, and are pleased to find a rather 2-Dimensional Pink Flamingo with thin metal legs. The lawnmower is approaching. What do you do?
	+ [Mount Up]
		With the grace of an ace pilot, you leap onto your steed. Startled it takes off into the sky,  leaving lawnmower, hedgemaze, and frustratingly tall grass behind. From up here you see it all, a medium-sized straw house, a large wood house, and a little brick house. There also appears to be a wrought-iron gazeebo in the center of the maze. Too scared to let go, you let the pink flamingo take you higher and higher so high that you can't breathe anymore. Slapping the flamingo wildly,  you try to get it to descend, but to no avail. The flamingo goes up and rests on a pillow-shaped cloud with a cloud-shaped pillow on top and a completely normal hover-clock floating nearby. Unfortunately it is at this moment your lungs cannot bear it anymore. Everything goes black.  {Death} You are dead. You float up out of your lifeless body and see the flamingo sleeping on the bed. What do you do?
		+ [Possess the Flamingo]
			You possess the flamingo, noting the hover-clock is set to three minutes from now.
