EPIC BATTLE DREAM

You wake up. You're in a castle. In front of you is a staff and a sword. What do you do?

+ [Pick the stuff]
		You picks the stuff. A group of Goblins appears. They are rushing towards you with daggers!
	+ [Stuff Attack!]
			You raise your staff and wave it towards an enemy.
			With a crisp sound, your staff breaks into two parts under the enemy's parry.
			At the next second, the Goblins easily captured you.
	+ [Retreat]
			You calmly analyze the situation and decide to go back some distance.
			At this time, you find that the Goblins are very close to each other, and your spells are ready.
			What do you do?
		+ [Fireball!]
				You chant the spell, summon a huge fireball.
				The fireball landed among the enemies, turning all of them into ashes.
		+ [Frost Ward!]
				You chant the spell, an ice barrier appears around your body.
				Goblins start using their daggers to attack you. But no effects.
				However, you are surrounded. What do you do?
			+ [Stuff Attack!]
						You raise your staff and wave it towards an enemy.
						The attack missed, but it makes your energy unstable.
						The ice barrier explodes and then repels the Goblins.
						You've also taken a lot of damage.
			+ [Wait for the Next Spell]
						You try to maintain the barrier, but quickly become exhausted.
						After that, the ice barrier collapses and you fall down.
	
+ [Take the sword]
  	You takes the sword. A Giant appears, with a huge rock in hand aiming at you!
  	What do you do?
	+ [Defend!]
			You raise your sword and adopt a defensive posture.
  		The rock hits you accurately and ruins this trivial defense
  		...along with your body.
	+ [Dodge!]
	  	You move quickly. The rock landed in your left. BOOM!!
    	With flying sand and dust, it is not able to see the situation over there.
    	What do you do next?
		+ [Charge!]
	      	"The best defense is to attack."
        	You rush towards the Giant, and use the sword to launch a continuous attack on it.
        	However, it dealt trivial damage.
        	On the next second, the Giant punches you, and then you fly tens of meters away...
		+ [Move Left]
	        You move left towards the position where the previous rock landed.
          You found a pit!
			+ [Jump into it!]
	            	You jump into the pit without hesitation!
              	... ...
              	It takes a few seconds to hit the bottom.
              	Though taking a great deal of damage, you left the battle alive.
			+ [Get closer to investigate]
	            You try to get closer to the pit, want to see the details.
              At the same time, the Giant's second rock flies to you.
              While you have no time to react.
              BOOM!!
		+ [Move Right]
	      	You move right, trying to find a good position.
        	At this time, the Giant lifts another rock, aiming at you!
			+ [Charge!]
	      		"The best defense is to attack."
        		You rush towards the Giant, and use the sword to launch a continuous attack on it.
        		However, it dealt trivial damage.
        		On the next second, the Giant punches you, and then you fly tens of meters away...
			+ [Defend!]
	      		You raise your sword and adopt a defensive posture.
        		The rock hits you accurately and ruins this trivial defense
        		...along with your body.
			+ [Dodge!]
	      		You are in a good position, so you escaped from that attack again.
        		... ...
        		After several rounds, the Giant exhausted.
				+ [Possess the Giant]
