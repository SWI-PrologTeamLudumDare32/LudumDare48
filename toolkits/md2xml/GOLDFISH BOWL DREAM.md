GOLDFISH BOWL DREAM

You wake up. You are a fish. A goldfish to be exact. Not a gold fish. That would have been cool, but it was too expensive to get one in the Ludum Dare time window. 
You look out and see a distorted room around you. You try to swim into that room, but you seem to bump into thin air. It's pretty cramped in here. Underneath you is a castle. Above you is a scary place you don't want to go. In front of you is your fishy reflection. Time is ticking. What do you do?
	

+ [Check out reflection]
	Your scales look so bright and orange today!

+ [Investigate castle]
	You swim down to the castle. Inside is a worm hole. What do you do?
	+ [Enter Worm Hole]
		You enter the worm hole. There is a worm inside in a little dirtbed. The worm is clearly sleeping. What do you do?
		+ [Approach Quietly]
			You sneakily swim over to the worm, briefly snag yourself on a wire and *THWAP*. You wake up. You are dead. You float out of your lifeless body and see your fish body pinned to the castle wall by a crossbow bolt. The worm is still asleep. What do you do?
			+ [Leave]
				You entered a worm hole. There is no turning back. 
			+ [Possess the Worm]			
	+ [Possess the Worm]
		You float over to the worm and attempt to possess her. Unfortunately, you are not a ghost, so you actually just rub all up on the worm, who immediately wakes up and shouts "GUARDS!" Two worm knights swoop in on their wyrm mounts and slice your head off. You wake up. You are dead. You float up out of your lifeless body and see the worm has rolled over and gone back to sleep. What do you do?
		+ [Possess the Worm]
	+ [Announce Your Presence]
		You announce your presence. The worm wakes up and throws a banana at you. You stare at the banana wondering what this is all about when --- PAKOW!!! a huge explosion followed by several smaller explosions BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! is the last thing you hear. You wake up. You are dead. You float up out of your lifeless body and see the castle is ruined and the worm has gone back to sleep. What do you do?
		+ [Leave the Castle]
			You leave the castle. You leave the fish bowl. Without even thinking, you immediately possess the cat who fell asleep next to the bowl. You notice the alarm clock on the cat's collar is set to stun, about one minute from now. You take the alarm clock and shove it into your ghost body as you dive into your next dream.
		+ [Possess the Worm]
			You possess the worm.
	+ [Leave and Face your greatest fear]
		On second thought you leave the castle to face your greatest fear.
		/YOLO. You swim to the top of the bowl. The black-and-white cat immediately snatches you out of the bowl with its teeth. As the cats jaws tear at your fishy carcass, you have no regrets. You faced your fear. Your fishlips curve into a smug smile before everything goes black. You wake up. You are dead. You float out of your lifeless body and out of the cat and see the cat is napping. Time is ticking. What do you do?
		+ [Pee on the cat]
			You drop some ectoplasm on the cat... Gross, and kinda mean. Fortunately the cat does not wake up. Time is ticking. What do you do?
			+ [Possess the cat]
				You possess the cat. You notice the alarm clock on the cat's collar is set to stun, roughly one minute from now.
