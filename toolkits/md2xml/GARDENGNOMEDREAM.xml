			<p>You wake up. As far as your eyes can see there is grass. It's a sunny day, but massive shadows drape across the grass. You look up a bit to see castle-wall-sized hedges all around you. &quot;This is amaze-ing,&quot; you exclaim in a shrill voice. You start hopping around with glee, but it's quite difficult to move as the blades of grass are huge and your legs appear to be stuck together. Suddenly, you hear an engine roar to life followed by the unmistakable sound of a lawnmower. The sound is getting closer. What do you /do?</p>

The last thing you see is bits of porcelain flying away from you. Then everything goes black. You wake up. You are dead. You float up out of your lifeless body - or what's left of it.

You were a fragile, yet sturdy little body and will be missed.&quot; A single ectoplasmic tear falls down your ghostly visage and onto the lawn. Without any warning at all, a pool of purple Fate-o-rade opens beneath you. Entranced by the infinity of small distant shapes dancing in the depths of that pool, you enter. You are now surrounded by liquid chaos: all possibilities morphing in and out of existence at once. The weight of this dimension drags you down making it difficult to float. What do you do?</p>

Trusty metal detector at hand, you beep your way to the very center of the maze. A large wrought-iron gazeebo rests there and-- As you approach the gazeebo, the metal detector starts beeping wildly.  Suddenly a land mine goes off.  Porcelain pieces fly everywhere, and everything goes black. You wake up. You are dead. Your metal detector is also dead. :( You float up out of your lifeless body and see a pigeon in a tiny little bed inside a nest. What do you do?</p>

			<p>With the grace of an ace pilot, you leap onto your steed. Startled it takes off into the sky,  leaving lawnmower, hedgemaze, and frustratingly tall grass behind. From up here you see it all, a medium-sized straw house, a large wood house, and a little brick house. There also appears to be a wrought-iron gazeebo in the center of the maze. Too scared to let go, you let the pink flamingo take you higher and higher so high that you can't breathe anymore. Slapping the flamingo wildly,  you try to get it to descend, but to no avail. The flamingo goes up and rests on a pillow-shaped cloud with a cloud-shaped pillow on top and a completely normal hover-clock floating nearby. Unfortunately it is at this moment your lungs cannot bear it anymore. Everything goes black.  {Death} You are dead. You float up out of your lifeless body and see the flamingo sleeping on the bed. What do you do?</p>

			<p>The lawnmower is very close.  You wait a moment as it hurtles down the hedge maze path with frightening speed and precision. As the lawnmower zooms past, the rather 2-Dimensional Pink Flamingo with thin metal legs takes off into the sky. You hop around the maze for hours, maybe even days. You hop left. You hop right. But most importantly, you keep on hopping until you find three little houses scattered about. One is made of straw, one of wood, and one of brick. What do you do?</p>
