				<p>You try to smash the alarm clock, but you have no arms. And you're not corporeal. And being a freshly-minted ghost you simply don't have the telekinetic strength. Too bad...</p>

				<p>Haunt Their Dreams!!!</p>
			</label>
			<reveal>
				<p>As you float over to the bed, you notice an alarm clock set to go off 2 minutes from now. Should the alarm clock go off before you find peace or possess another dreamer, you will be lost in the Unconscious until your sleeper goes back to sleep. You're certain your lover is somewhere in the Collective Subconscious; after all, with only seven degrees of separation between any two people and the fact that random people can show up in others' dreams, they must be in there somewhere. You are about to enter your first dream. You possess the sleeper. Oops! You almost forgot; you reach out, take the alarm clock, and shove it in your ghostly body. You can set the alarm clock off anytime to wake the current dream's sleeper and restart the dream they are in. So don't be afraid to go deeper, good luck, and remember to Haunt Their Dreams!!!  {sound}</p>
