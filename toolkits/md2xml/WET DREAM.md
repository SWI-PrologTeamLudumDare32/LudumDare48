WETDREAM

You wake up. You are underwater. You are also a fish. A bigger fish eats you. You are dead. You float up out of your lifeless body... Underwater levels always suck. Remembering this, you look for the quickest possible exit. There is a ballerina shark coming right at you. There is also a Lamprey with a tophat and blue waistcoat slowly undulating upwards. And check that out: there's a kelp bed beneath you.
